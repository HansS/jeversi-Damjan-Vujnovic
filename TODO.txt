- server user management: announce users, show waiting status...
- usernames not just white/black
- integrated login through google/twitter/fb?
- better ui? graphics?

- page refresh protection, reconnection
- server statistics (won/lost per player)
- stress test
- memory leak test

- observable collections. pushevent should really be just _events.push with an observer that triggers an external event 
- should observable.addListener be aliased with observable.on to be compatible with EventEmiter in node?
- deal with static functions next/flippable/chain etc... do they belong to a value object we don't know about? 
- stop persisting events?
